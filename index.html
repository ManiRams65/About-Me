<h2>I am Manikandan. A junior year undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at RMK College of Engineering and Technology, Kavaraipettai.

   <p> One of the most important skills that I believe that I’ve acquired, is the skill to adapt myself for anything quickly. </p>
    
   
    
    Being a computer enthusiast as a young teenager I developed an early interest in technology and computers. I’ve worked with HTML,CSS and Bootstrap in college and personal projects. One of my most important projects is Integration of RTO,Police,Insurance using a web porta.It is available in the 000webhost for free and is still constantly being improved almost every week.
